# Blockchain-Based Retail Store Opening/Closing Management

This repository contains a decentralized solution for managing retail store opening and closing procedures using blockchain technology. The system ensures transparency, accountability, and consistency in daily store operations across multiple locations.

4. **Compliance Tracking Contract**: Monitors and documents adherence to security protocols and company policies

## Key Features
